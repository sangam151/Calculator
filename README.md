This project implements a Hybrid Calculator in C++ by combining two classes:

SimpleCalculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
ScientificCalculator: Performs advanced scientific calculations such as sine, cosine, tangent, and logarithmic operations.
The HybridCalculator class inherits from both, demonstrating the concepts of inheritance and code reusability in Object-Oriented Programming.
